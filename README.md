We present a repository with sensor data collected from 10 players in 22 matches in League of Legends.
The sensor data collected include:
1. Hand/head/chair movements.
1. Heart rate.
1. Muscle activity.
1. Gaze movement on the monitor.
1. Galvanic skin response(GSR).
1. Electroencephalography (EEG).
1. Mouse and keyboard activity.
1. Facial skin temperature.
1. Environmental data.

The data were collected for one team of 5 people simultaneously. We also provide in-game logs and meta information for each match.
